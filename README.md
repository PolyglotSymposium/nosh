# Nosh - Nope, Semacrolon, Happle

## Nope - "NO ParEnthesis" (sort of) - "Nope I won't add more features" (probably)

Syntax language with extremely simple syntax. Parser is total. Not Turing
complete.

## Semacrolon - "Semicolon" / "Macro" mashup

Macro language hosted in Nope. Not Turing complete.

## Happle - "Hapax" (Greek) / "Simple"

Strongly typed functional language hosted in Nope, compatible for preprocessing
with Semacrolon.

ALL OF THIS IS NOTHING BUT A TOY RIGHT NOW
